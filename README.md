# memoryGif

This is a simple memory game for web I made during a hackathon project day at </salt>.
it works like any memory game but instead of images this one uses gifs.

The Brief

To create an application with both a frontend and a backend.
the application also needed to utilize an external API of my own choosing.

What I made

I ended up making this memory game using Giphys API (https://developers.giphy.com/).
the game is fully functional and can be started, ended, and then restarted again.
only the backend communicates with Giphys API and serves only rick and morty Gifs to the frontend on request. the game itself (and all the logic that comes with it) all lives on the front end.

## Technologies used:

### Backend

Express.js
(https://expressjs.com/)

### FrontEnd

React.js
(https://reactjs.org/)

## Future Improvements

- give user a choice for what kinds of Gifs the memory game will use (not just rick and morty once).
- build a leader-board for players high score.
- to launch this website and make it accessible online.
